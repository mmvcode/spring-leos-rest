# spring-nio-rest

Spring Boot Project showing how efficient nio REST services (Callable & RxJava's Observable) can be, instead of blocking REST services.

Swagger documentation available at path `/v2/api-docs`.

## Considerations
* Load tests have been performed using [loadtest](https://github.com/alexfernandez/loadtest). 
* The business operation has been set up so that it takes 500msec to process.

## Results

### Synchronous controller

The response time degrades as the test runs. 99% of the requests end up taking up to 25 seconds after one minute, with increasing latency and server errors (1 out of 4 requests).

    >>loadtest -c 15 -t 60 --rps 700 http://localhost:8080/sync/data

### Asynchronous controller with Callable

It is able to process up to the rps setup limit (700), with no errors and having the response time only limited by the business service's processing time: 

    >>loadtest -c 15 -t 60 --rps 700 http://localhost:8080/callable/data    
    ...
    Requests: 0, requests per second: 0, mean latency: 0 ms
    Requests: 2839, requests per second: 568, mean latency: 500 ms
    Requests: 6337, requests per second: 700, mean latency: 500 ms
    Requests: 9836, requests per second: 700, mean latency: 500 ms
    Requests: 13334, requests per second: 700, mean latency: 500 ms
    Requests: 16838, requests per second: 701, mean latency: 500 ms
    Requests: 20336, requests per second: 700, mean latency: 500 ms
    Requests: 23834, requests per second: 700, mean latency: 500 ms
    Requests: 27338, requests per second: 701, mean latency: 500 ms

    Requests: 34334, requests per second: 700, mean latency: 500 ms
    Requests: 37834, requests per second: 700, mean latency: 500 ms
    Requests: 41336, requests per second: 700, mean latency: 500 ms

    Target URL:          http://localhost:8080/async/data
    Max time (s):        60
    Concurrency level:   15
    Agent:               none
    Requests per second: 700

    Completed requests:  41337
    Total errors:        0
    Total time:          60.002348360999996 s
    Requests per second: 689
    Total time:          60.002348360999996 s

    Percentage of the requests served within a certain time

      99%      512 ms
     100%      527 ms (longest request)

Pushing it to its limits it manages to cope with up to an impressive 1700 rps (99996 requests in a minute) without errors:

### Asynchronous controller with RxJava's Observable

It's performance is slightly better than the Callable version

    >>loadtest -c 15 -t 60 --rps 1700 http://localhost:8080/observable/data
    Requests: 0, requests per second: 0, mean latency: 0 ms
    Requests: 6707, requests per second: 1341, mean latency: 560 ms
    Requests: 15070, requests per second: 1675, mean latency: 560 ms
    Requests: 23658, requests per second: 1716, mean latency: 630 ms
    Requests: 31620, requests per second: 1594, mean latency: 570 ms
    Requests: 40698, requests per second: 1816, mean latency: 730 ms
    Requests: 49173, requests per second: 1695, mean latency: 560 ms
    ...
    Completed requests:  100088
    Total errors:        0
    Total time:          60.000421678 s
    Requests per second: 1668
    Total time:          60.000421678 s
